## [0.1.2]

### Added

- Added a new package `tensnap-web-core` providing:
  - High-performance chart rendering using Leafer-UI
  - Layer-based & flexible Grid & graph renderers
  - Type-safe data models
  - Utility functions for data processing
- This allows for:
  - Independent testing and benchmarking of core functionality
  - Reuse in different frameworks or Node.js environments
  - Clear separation between UI and project management logic
- Added a standardized benchmark suite for the renderers in the `tensnap-web-core` package.
- Added a new feature to allow one to drag or zoom on an environment.
- Optimized the performance of the example Schelling Segregation Model.

### Removed

- The old `InstantiatedChartStorage`, `GridVisualizer`, `GraphVisualizer` etc. are removed.

### Security

- Update all `npm` and Tauri dependencies to newest versions.
- There is a known bug that graph environments blink during evolution. This is a defect caused by the very design of the protocol and is anticipated to be fixed during the next release.
